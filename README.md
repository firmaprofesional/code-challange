# Firmaprofesional Code Challenge

The Firmaprofesional code challenge is an opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in the problem solving skills we expect you to use at Firmaprofesional.

## Expectations

Create a new git repository for that project. Organize your code within that repo -- when you get to a stopping point, commit and push your code and email a link to your repo to [Miquel](mailto:mllagostera@firmaprofesional.com).

#### Time Allotment

We respect your time and don't want you spending one day on your challenge, the challenges are scoped for 1-3 hr timeframe.

#### Your Challenge README

Include the following items in your `README`:

* Description of the problem and solution.
* Reasoning behind your technical choices. Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.

#### Commit History

Use whatever development workflow works best for you, we use develop/feature/hotfix but it's only our choice. If your solution is small enough and a single commit is justified, that's fine; we just ask that you keep your [commit history as coherent as possible](https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/codebase/dev/git/clean-commits/).

## What We Review

* **Clarity:** Does the README clearly explain the problem and solution?
* **Correctness:** Does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
* **Code Quality:** Is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?
* **Testing:** If required - how thorough are the automated tests? Will they be difficult to change if the requirements of the application were to change?
* **Technical Choices:** Do choices of libraries, databases, architecture seem appropriate for the challenge?
